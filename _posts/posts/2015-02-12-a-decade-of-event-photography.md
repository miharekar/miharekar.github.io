Exactly **10 years ago** I went to my first ever concert as a photographer. It was by [Omar Naber](http://www.omarnaber.com/) in Escape club in Celje and I made a lot of awful photos. [Matjaž Očko](http://www.matjazocko.com/) from [M2O](http://m2o.si/) was there to guide me and I still **failed miserably**. This is about the only one that doesn't completely suck and I still don't like it.

What I'm trying to say is that sometimes it's nice to take a trip down the memory lane to see where you come from and what you've achieved. And remember - if you **like doing something** just **keep at it** and you will get better. I promise!
