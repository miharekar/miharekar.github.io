We all know what it is and we all should use it. Oh, and [GitHub supports it now too](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication). The problem is the de-facto app used for TFA - Google Authenticator. This thing is so bad that even Google doesn't trust it:

This is not an ad but I just found out about [**Authy**](https://www.authy.com/) and it's awesome and you should use it!

Bonus: They have a ton of [developer resources](https://www.authy.com/developer) on how to implement TFA in your app(s). And if you're using some of the most popular frameworks/languages, they also provide [libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/authy).
