If you follow me on any social network[^1] you might have seen that I participated in the [Pebble Time](https://getpebble.com/pebble_time) [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises). Maybe you also saw that I recently received this wonderful gadget:

First impression when I put it around my wrist was how thin and light it is. Just like a regular watch or probably even thinner. Its strap is also of much higher quality than I imagined. I thought it'll be of cheap-ish plastic and that I'll sweat under it but I barely do - even when running. It's awesome.

Using it has also been much easier than I imagined. Its UX is intuitive to the point where you don't need any manual. Oh, there is none. But that's OK. Left side has only one button - back. Right side has 3 buttons: up, down, confirm. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

When I was backing the project on Kickstarter I was most looking forward to [Runkeeper](http://runkeeper.com/) integration. They were exposed as a major partner so I thought they'll provide an awesome app. But they only provide a basic integration with [Pebble Sports API](http://developer.getpebble.com/guides/mobile-apps/ios/ios-sports/). While running you can pause the run and see the duration, distance, and average pace of your run. There's a [support ticket for customization](https://support.runkeeper.com/hc/communities/public/questions/201697299-Custom-Display-on-Smartwatches) with 101 upvotes[^2] but without any response from Runkeeper.

So I looked at my favorite alternative when Runkeeper doesn't work properly - [Strava](https://www.strava.com/). They don't even have support for Pebble on iOS. Because reasons. Again there is a [support ticket](https://strava.zendesk.com/entries/25274229-Strava-support-for-Pebble-on-iOS) with 77 likes[^2] and again without any official response.

Reading those support requests and comments I stumbled upon a running app of which I haven't heard before - [iSmoothRun](http://www.ismoothrun.com/). It doesn't have a subscription model or a social network build around it and it's a [paid app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ismoothrun-pro-gps-pedometer/id410965399) upfront. But what it has is an **awesome** [Pebble app](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/531313914f9d0efadb000149). And features. [Tons of features](http://www.ismoothrun.com/features.html)[^3]. Just to name a few:

- customizable Pebble display - choose from myriad of possible data points and display them on pages of 3
- automatic metronome - only active when your cadence drops below a threshold
- support of all the possible heart rate sensors[^4]
- automatic weather conditions logging
- master switch for all audio cues[^5]
- custom interval training with heart rate coaching
- ghost runs
- amazing and detailed graphs and statistics after the run
- export to all the other services[^6] - it'll even share your run live to Runkeeper

I could go on for days. It's so amazing. And you can tell why by their tagline:

> Programmed by runners, iSmoothRun is the app that we all wished for.

It's as if all the other running apps were created by aliens imagining how people run and why/how would they use their apps. This one is the only one that just works. And makes perfect sense. Kudos, developers. And keep up the good work!

[^4]: I highly recommend [Polar H7](http://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/H7_heart_rate_sensor)
[^5]: Can't even begin to explain how awesome this is if you run both with and without headphones
[^6]: I prefer Dropbox and from there [tapiriik](https://tapiriik.com/) takes over - old habitsâ€¦
