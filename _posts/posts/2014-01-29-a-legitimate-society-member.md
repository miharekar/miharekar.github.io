I was recently a guest in the [Apparatus podcast](http://apparatus.si/). Apparatus is self described as a podcast where legitimate society members share what they are doing in life. It was/is a huge honor for me so I'm sharing this with you. The podcast itself is unfortunately in slovene.

So if you understand slovene and wanna hear what I had to say, have a listen in [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/si/podcast/apparatus/id586188053) or on the [web](http://apparatus.si/miha-rekar/).
