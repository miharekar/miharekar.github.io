**I hate `foobar` examples.** There, I've finally said it.

It makes a steeper learning curve since you have to imagine what foo and bar could stand for in the real-world scenario. This is especially noticeable for beginners who have no idea WTF is going on.

At least 50% of our job is naming things. If `foo` & `bar` is the best you can come up with, then please go do something else.
