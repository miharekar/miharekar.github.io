I don't write enough here and I should work on that. But at least this time I have a plausible excuse - events. **SO MUCH EVENTS**. And not one free weekend.

So let me :warning: warn :warning: you - this is going to be a long post.

## Zagreb - March 11th

We begin this journey on Saturday at [Toptal Speakers Conference](http://toptalspeakerszagreb.eu/) in Zagreb. It was a whole day workshop on improving public speaking skills and everything that comes with it. There were a couple of good talks but I especially enjoyed Public Speaking Is Your Legacy by [Tomaž Zaman](http://zaman.io/). He presented great reasons on why we should do talks and how to use them for boosting our credibility.

## Wrocław - March 13-20th

2 days later I embarked on a journey towards Wrocław, Poland where I would spend a week with my teammates. I recently acquired a new car[^1] so I opted for a road trip instead of a plane ride. Because it's quite a long drive[^2] and [I love coffee](/posts/2016/04/26/in-quest-of-a-better-coffee/) I decided to stop in Brno and visit my friends at [European Coffee Trip](https://europeancoffeetrip.com/).

The last part of the trip was the most exciting[^3] - Polish highways. They drive at 2 speeds only: either they go 180 km/h or you're behind a truck going 80 km/h[^4]. I decided that my trip back will be avoiding highways if at all possible.

The next couple of days I was running around[^5] Wrocław, tasting the food, coffee, and generally enjoying the city. I even got to meet the **2016 World AeroPress champion** [Filip Kucharczyk](https://twitter.com/kucharczykfilip). But the most important part was working together and spending quality time with my teammates and other coworkers from [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/).

Remote work has many advantages but it can get a bit lonely and you might get the [Cabin fever](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3658-cabin-fever). About a week long team-wide get-togethers are a perfect blend of work and fun to counter that. You get to spend a lot of time just with each other, no one else. It gets very intense but in the end it's totally worth it. It's like a condensed version of office life - you get to know your colleagues incredibly well in a matter of days.

I highly recommend visiting Wrocław. It's a beautiful city with nice architecture, great food, and awesome night life. Everyone is super nice and speaks perfect English.

## wroc_love.rb - March 17-19th

The real reason we picked Wrocław as a place to meet was the [wroc_love.rb](http://www.wrocloverb.com/) Ruby conference. The conference was rather peculiar - it started on Friday at 17:00[^6]. I don't know whose idea it was that after a full day of work people will enjoy 3h of conference talks. Also it was weird that all the speakers were male given that the crowd was more diverse than usual. What I really liked was that every day ended with a round of 10 impromptu lightning talks. More conferences should do that since it exposes you to so many different topics in a very short amount of time.

## Little Karst Marathon (Mali kraški maraton) - March 26th

The next weekend I went to the West of our small country[^7] for the first official half marathon of the season. [MKM](http://www.kraskimaraton.si/)[^8] is the traditional running season start event. The route is rather hilly[^9] and this year it was extremely windy as well. However the winter trainings paid off - I [ran my personal best](http://smashrun.com/mrfoto/run/8034810): **1:39:14**. :beers:

## RubyConfBY - April 2nd

Come next weekend it was time for my biggest speaker gigs to date: [Belarus Ruby Conference](http://rubyconference.by/en/). I mean, look at this:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/posts/2017-05-03-rubyconfby.jpg" title="RubyConf BY 2017 speakers">
</figure>

I got to present at the same conference as Ruby and Rails core member [Aaron Patterson](http://tenderlovemaking.com/)[^10], co-lead of JRuby [Charles Nutter](http://blog.headius.com/)[^11], and RuboCop author [Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com/)[^12] amongst others. I first saw Aaron [deliver a keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kgUL_FfUZY) ago at RailsConf in Portland. If someone told me that 4 years later I'll be giving a talk on the same conference as him I'd ask them to seek professional help.

My talk was the last talk of the day and I spoke about [Flame Graphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html). According to [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/mrfoto/what-are-flame-graphs-and-how-to-read-them) I became interested in them in _December 2014_ when I had to find out why a certain page was super slow. After reading many blogs posts and videos and figuring out how to read them I made an internal presentation for my coworkers. Over a year later I made a [lightning talk](http://www.rug.si/2016/05/26/may-meetup-recap/) at our local meetup[^13]. The responses were really good so when I got asked to fill-in for a speaker about a month later at [RubyC 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHsJJ0N230) I picked this topic as well. Then in November I got invited to do that same talk in Israel on [DevconTLV X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIo0cEhT-Js). Every time I did it, I added some things, removed some things, improved other things. So here are [the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/mrfoto/what-are-flame-graphs-and-how-to-read-them-rubyconfby-2017) and the end result:

Sure there are tons of things I could improve but I had a feeling it went well. And yesterday I got the confirmation of that - the organisers have sent me all the feedbacks of my talk that they gathered. Pasted unedited:
- Miha rocks.
- Entertaining but the same. (I am also biased here.)
- Inspiring to wide usage of Flame Graphs
- I was tired by the end of the day, but this talk was very interesting to listen to.
- Very clear and accesssible
- Not often you need to read flame graphs, but it is good to remember it. Useful.
- thats awesome

Not too shabby.

## London Coffee Festival - April 12-15th

As you know by now - [coffee is a huge passion of mine]((/posts/2016/04/26/in-quest-of-a-better-coffee/)). Which is why I went to one of the biggest festivals in Europe - [London Coffee Festival](https://www.londoncoffeefestival.com/). Now I knew that London coffee scene is huge, but I had **no idea** how massive it really is. To give you some idea: Lloyd from [The Coffee Roasters](https://thecoffeeroasters.co.uk/)[^14] gifted me a booklet called **The London Coffee Guide 2017**. It's the **definitive guide** to the **best independent coffee venues** in London[^15]. And that booklet alone contains **245** venues. **245**!!! And for every one of them there's a detailed description of what espresso machine(s) they have, what grinder(s) they use, a little back story,…, absolutely incredible.

Anyway, back to the festival. This thing was endless - there were over 250 stalls over 3 floors and every one of them was meticulously crafted. They were so well designed, everyone was so nice and friendly, it really was a magical experience.

## WebCamp Ljubljana - April 22nd

The last crazy weekend was [WebCamp Ljubljana](http://2017.webcamp.si/). It's a yearly get-together of all the local developers. Every year I look forward to it more and more since I get to see faces I know from the online world but rarely see in the _real world_. Many of us work remotely or in offices all over the world[^16] so we don't get to see each other that often. And on top of that - _[Jure](http://www.jurecuhalev.com/) [& Co.](http://2017.webcamp.si/team/)_ always manage to get great speakers and organize the whole event flawlessly. And this year was no different. The talks were a stark contrast to other conferences I've been to over the past few weeks. Very diverse - not just speaker-wise, but also content-wise. Everything from deep technical talks, _soft_ talks about depression, to LGBTQI+ talk panel. They went above and beyond this year. Can't wait to see what awaits us next year. :grin:
