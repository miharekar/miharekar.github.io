I used to be a PHP Developer. Then I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and that light was **Ruby**. I wanted to share this revelation so I started [Slovenia Ruby User Group](http://www.rug.si/). When I'm not programming or organizing I like to take photos[^1] and run. Not necessarily at once.

[^1]: The photo blog that used to be here has been moved to [b.mr.si](http://b.mr.si/). It's old but there are still some nice pictures (and stories if you understand Slovene) you might enjoy.
