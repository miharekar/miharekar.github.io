### Short Bio

I used to be a PHP Developer. Then I saw the light at the end of the tunnel and that light was **Ruby**. I wanted to share this revelation so I started [**Slovenia Ruby User Group**](http://www.rug.si/). When I'm not programming or organizing I like to give talks, make coffee, take photos[^1], and run. Not necessarily at once.

### Photos[^2]
