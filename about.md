### Short Bio

I'm a PHP developer turned Ruby who loves building things that make people's lives better. I'm also the creator of [Visualizer](https://visualizer.coffee), a tool for coffee enthusiasts.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me running marathons, making specialty coffee, taking photos[^1], or writing in my daily journal. Not necessarily at once.

I used to host a [podcast about hobbies that tech people have](http://parallelpassion.com/) and run the [Slovenia Ruby User Group](http://www.rug.si/). The podcast is long dead, but the group is still going strong.

### Photos[^2]
